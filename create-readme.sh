# Advent of Code - JavaScript Solutions

Welcome to my repository for solving the **Advent of Code** challenges using **JavaScript**!

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to each day's puzzle from the **Advent of Code** event. The puzzles range from simple algorithmic challenges to more complex problems involving grid traversal, pattern matching, and more. Each solution is written in JavaScript, and I strive to implement clean and efficient code.

## Challenges Solved

- **Day 01:** Solved a problem involving sorting and comparing two sets of values. Part 1 calculates the total sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements in the two sets. Part 2 involves counting the frequency of values in the second set and calculating a weighted sum of the values from the first set based on their frequency.
- **Day 02:** Solved a sequence safety problem. Part 1 checks if a sequence of numbers is safe based on a set of conditions involving directionality and differences. Part 2 modifies the sequence by removing elements and rechecking the sequence's safety based on specific rules.
- **Day 03:** Solved a pattern matching problem with a focus on multiplication. Part 1 and Part 2 involved parsing a set of multiplication operations and calculating the sum of products based on certain conditions. The solution involved regex pattern matching to extract the values and compute the sum.
- **Day 04:** Solved grid traversal and directional pattern matching. Part 1 identifies and counts occurrences of 'X' surrounded by a specific sequence of symbols ('M', 'A', 'S') in all eight directions. Part 2 checks for a flipped pattern between 'M' and 'S' symbols adjacent to 'A' in a specific configuration, and counts the valid occurrences.


## Installation

To run any solution, clone this repository and open the relevant file in your favorite JavaScript environment. Make sure to have **Node.js** installed on your machine if you want to run the scripts directly.

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/David-patrick-chuks/AdventOfCode-2024.git
cd AdventOfCode-2024
\`\`\`

## How to Run

For each dayâ€™s solution, simply run the respective \`.js\` file using Node.js. For example, for Day 04:

\`\`\`bash
node Day4.js
\`\`\`

## Repo Structure

- \`Day1.js\`: Solution for Day 01
- \`Day2.js\`: Solution for Day 02
- \`Day3.js\`: Solution for Day 03
- \`Day4.js\`: Solution for Day 04

Each dayâ€™s solution is placed in its own file for easy navigation.
